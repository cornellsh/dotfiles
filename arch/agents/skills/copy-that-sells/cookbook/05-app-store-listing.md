# Example 5: App Store listing

A worked example of the skill applied to an iOS App Store listing for a fictional consumer savings app called "Aside."

---

## The brief from the user

> We're launching Aside on iOS. It is a savings app that rounds up every card purchase to the nearest dollar and saves the change automatically. We have a partner bank, so the savings sit in a real account with 4.5% APY. The target user is 22 to 30 in the US, employed, has trouble saving. We need: app name, subtitle, promotional text, short description (3 lines above the fold), full description, and 5 screenshot captions. Voice: confident, light, plain. Not preachy.

Inputs extracted:

- One thing: get the visitor to tap "Get" and install.
- Reader: 22 to 30 year old in the US, has $0 to $3,000 in savings, makes card purchases daily.
- Belief shift: from "I cannot save because I have no discipline" to "the change adds up if I do not have to think about it."
- Promise: spare change becomes real savings at 4.5% APY without the user noticing.
- Proof: partner bank, 4.5% APY, real account, FDIC implied through partner.
- Format: App Store listing. App name 30 chars, subtitle 30 chars, promotional text 170 chars, screenshot captions 4 to 8 words each, full description (first 3 lines above fold).
- Voice: Voice 1 (dry confident) blended with Voice 5 (conspirator). Light, no preaching.
- CTA: install (the Get button).

## The output

### Idea
The change you would have lost adds up faster than the savings you would have made.

### Final copy

**App name (30 chars)**
> Aside: Round Up & Save

**Subtitle (30 chars)**
> Spare change. Real interest.

**Promotional text (170 chars)**
> Aside rounds up every card purchase and saves the change at 4.5% APY. No card to swipe twice. No form to fill. The savings show up while you are doing something else.

**First 3 lines of description (above the fold)**
> Aside saves the change from every card swipe. The account earns 4.5% APY. You will not feel the savings, but you will see the balance.

**Full description (below the fold)**
> **How it works**
> Link your card. We watch the purchases. Every time you spend, we round up to the next dollar and move the change into a high-yield savings account at our partner bank. The change adds up faster than you expect.
>
> **What you get**
> - 4.5% APY on the savings balance
> - FDIC insured up to $250,000 (through our partner bank)
> - Automatic round-ups on every linked card
> - No monthly fee, no minimum balance
> - Pause or withdraw any time
>
> **Why people use it**
> The average user saves $42 a month from round-ups alone. Some users add a recurring weekly transfer on top. After a year the balance is real money and the user did almost nothing.
>
> **Privacy**
> We do not sell your purchase data. We see the round up amount. That is the only thing we use.
>
> **Support**
> Reply to any in-app message and a person answers within a few hours.

**Screenshot captions (5)**

1. > Round up every swipe.
2. > 4.5% APY. Real account.
3. > Watch the balance grow.
4. > One tap to withdraw.
5. > No monthly fee.

### Alternates

1. **Subtitle: "Save without thinking about it."** Tradeoff: more emotional, less specific. The "4.5% APY" version converts harder on a financial product where the APY is competitive.
2. **Subtitle: "Your spare change at 4.5%."** Same idea, fewer words. Use if A/B test rewards compression.
3. **Promotional text: lead with the dollar figure.** "Aside users save $42 a month from spare change alone, at 4.5% APY." Tradeoff: stronger number, weaker mechanism explanation.
4. **Screenshot caption 3 (variant): "$42 a month, on average."** Trades the universal ("watch the balance grow") for the specific number.

### Notes

Character counts (measured with `wc -c`, not estimated):
- App name: 22 chars (max 30).
- Subtitle: 28 chars (max 30).
- Promotional text: 166 chars (max 170).
- First 3 lines of description: 134 chars total. Inside the iOS "more" fold.
- Screenshot captions: 4 to 5 words each. Inside the readable limit for portrait screenshot overlays.

Framework doing the work: AIDA at the listing level. Attention is the app name + subtitle. Interest is the promotional text and the 3-line above-fold description. Desire is the "How it works," "What you get," and "Why people use it" sections. Action is the Get button (Apple controls the button itself; the copy works around it).

Voice craft moves applied:
- Voice 1 carries the specifics ("4.5% APY," "FDIC insured up to $250,000," "$42 a month").
- Voice 5 carries the wink ("the savings show up while you are doing something else," "the user did almost nothing").
- No preaching. The "Privacy" section says one thing and stops.

Self-edit pass: read aloud at scrolling pace. No em dashes. No banned vocabulary. The list bullets are genuinely list-like content (features), not paragraph filler dressed as a list. The screenshot captions hold the voice across five separate frames.

The $42 a month figure is flagged in Notes as needing verification before publication; in production, the actual product analytics would replace the placeholder.

Compliance flag (regulated category, see `self-edit.md` Layer 3): "4.5% APY" needs "variable, subject to change" treatment and a date; "FDIC insured up to $250,000 (through our partner bank)" must match the partner bank's required disclosure language exactly; the average-savings claim needs substantiation on file. None of this changes the copy above; it ships to legal with the flags attached.

## Postmortem: what the skill did

The briefing pass identified the App Store as a stack of small character limits, each with its own job. The skill wrote each limit as its own piece of copy, then verified character counts before finalising. This is the discipline App Store copy demands and most generators skip.

The voice blend was the central craft decision. Pure Voice 1 (dry confident) on a savings app for 22 to 30 year olds reads as a bank. Pure Voice 5 (conspirator) reads as not serious enough for a financial product. The blend lets the listing carry the APY specificity (Voice 1) and the lightness ("you will not feel the savings, but you will see the balance," Voice 5).

The above-the-fold 3 lines are the entire ad. The skill treated them as a billboard inside the App Store: idea, mechanism, payoff, in 162 characters. Below the fold, the description fills out the features and the proof, but the install decision is made above.

The screenshot captions do not describe the screenshots. They add the promise the screenshot cannot. "Round up every swipe" is the promise the screen of round-ups completes. "4.5% APY. Real account." adds the proof to a screen showing a balance. Captions that say "Home screen" or "Settings" waste the slot.

What to steal from this example: App Store copy is a stack of character-limited slots. Each slot has its own job. The 3 lines above the fold are a billboard. The screenshot captions add what the screenshot cannot. The full description below the fold carries the structured argument and the proof. The whole listing has to hold one voice across very different formats inside one page.
